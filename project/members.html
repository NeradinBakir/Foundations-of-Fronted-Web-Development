        <p class="text-center mb-5">For all that is being done today, credit goes to the founders, brave individuals who recognized the need for change and embarked on their vision together. These pioneers, inspired by the desire to create a better environment for youth, gathered with enthusiasm and determination to establish the first youth association. Their dedication, vision, and selfless commitment to the youth idea enabled the creation of a space where young people could gather, exchange ideas, develop skills, and contribute together to a better future for the community. Their initial steps laid the foundation for the long-term impact of the youth organization, leaving a lasting imprint on the lives of young people and the broader community.</p>
