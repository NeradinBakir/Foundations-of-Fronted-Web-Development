        <h1 align="center">Youth Association "STARt" Hadžići</h1>
        <h2 class="text-center mb-5"> <u>When and why we were created?</u></h2>
        <p class="text-center mb-5"> At the founding session in Hadžići in July 2023, the first youth association in Hadžići since the establishment of the municipality was formed. A group of confused young people, eager for knowledge and space in the local community, created the association. Twelve members attended the founding session, from all parts of Hadžići. From that first day, it was evident that there was a good energy and self-confidence among the youth.</p>
